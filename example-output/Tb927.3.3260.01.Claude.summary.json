The gene shows <strong>consistent downregulation patterns</strong> in mRNA degradation experiments and <strong>stage-specific differences</strong> with higher expression in procyclic forms compared to bloodstream forms in most datasets. <ul><li>Robust response to mRNA degradation pathways regardless of specific conditions</li><li>Preferential expression in insect-stage parasites</li><li>Sensitivity to RNA helicase DHH1 mutations</li><li>Stable expression during vector development</li></ul> The gene's consistent expression levels and degradation sensitivity suggest it may encode a constitutively required protein with post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms.",
