  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene shows <strong>dramatically higher expression in bloodstream forms compared to procyclic forms</strong> of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, with expression levels consistently <strong>5-15 fold higher in mammalian host stages</strong>. The gene exhibits <strong>peak expression in long slender bloodstream forms</strong> and shows <strong>rapid downregulation during differentiation to procyclic forms</strong>. Expression is <strong>enhanced in specialized tissues</strong> including adipose tissue and cerebrospinal fluid compared to blood. <strong>Ribosome profiling data indicates active translation in bloodstream forms</strong>, with translation efficiency markedly higher than transcription levels. The consistent bloodstream-specific upregulation across multiple experimental conditions suggests this gene plays a <strong>critical role in mammalian host adaptation</strong>, potentially involved in metabolic processes or virulence factors required for survival in the mammalian bloodstream environment.",
