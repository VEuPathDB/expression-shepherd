  "one_paragraph_summary": "This <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> gene exhibits <strong>stage-specific expression patterns</strong> with peak activity during early intracellular development. Expression is <strong>dramatically upregulated</strong> in intracellular stages (15.7-66.63 TPM) compared to oocysts (0.37 TPM), representing a ~42-fold increase. The gene shows <strong>temporal regulation</strong> with highest expression at 12-24 hours post-infection, followed by decline at later time points. Expression remains <strong>consistently low or undetectable</strong> in sporozoites and oocysts across multiple studies. This expression pattern suggests the gene plays a <strong>critical role in early infection establishment</strong> and parasite development within host cells, potentially involved in metabolic processes or host cell manipulation during the initial stages of parasitic life cycle progression.",
