For example, light-responsive peaks and carbon-specific upregulations are apparent in several experiments.</li><li>Observations suggest the gene could be involved in core cellular pathways, possibly linked to metabolic processes or stress responses, given its expression dynamics. Further functional studies may clarify its biological implications.</li></ul>",
