  "headline": "Sporozoite-Specific Expression with Strong Developmental Regulation Throughout Malaria Life Cycle",
  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>dramatic sporozoite-specific upregulation</strong> with expression levels reaching >2000 TPM (99th percentile) in sporozoites compared to minimal expression in asexual blood stages (<5 TPM). The gene shows <strong>strong cyclical expression</strong> during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, with biphasic patterns featuring peaks during early ring stages and late schizont stages, suggesting dual roles in invasion and egress processes. Expression is consistently elevated in <strong>sexual stages</strong>, particularly gametocyte stage V and ookinetes, indicating importance in transmission. The gene also demonstrates <strong>preferential expression in mosquito-derived versus cultured sporozoites</strong>, suggesting environmental or vector-dependent regulation. Given its sporozoite-specific expression pattern and transmission stage preference, this gene likely encodes a protein critical for sporozoite infectivity, host cell invasion, or early establishment of infection in mammalian hosts.",
