  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>dramatically elevated expression during sexual development</strong> in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, with 20-25 fold increases in enteroepithelial stages (EES1-5) compared to asexual stages, reaching 2,500-2,800 TPM in the feline intestinal environment. Expression remains <strong>consistently high in tachyzoites</strong> (600-1,100 TPM) across multiple strains and time points, while being <strong>substantially lower in bradyzoites and oocyst stages</strong>. The gene shows <strong>cell cycle-dependent regulation</strong> with periodic expression patterns and varies by <strong>host cell type and infection context</strong>. <ul><li>Peak expression occurs during sexual reproduction in feline hosts</li><li>Maintains high levels during rapid tachyzoite replication</li><li>Reduced during chronic infection and cyst formation</li></ul> This expression pattern suggests critical roles in both sexual reproduction and acute infection processes.",
