  "headline": "Bradyzoite-specific expression with dramatic upregulation during chronic infection",
  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>remarkable stage-specific expression</strong> in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, being dramatically upregulated in bradyzoites compared to all other life cycle stages. Expression increases <strong>over 3000-fold during tachyzoite-to-bradyzoite conversion</strong> and reaches extremely high levels (>6000 TPM) in tissue cysts during chronic infection. The gene shows <strong>minimal expression in tachyzoites, merozoites, oocysts, and enteroepithelial stages</strong>, but ranks in the 99th percentile during bradyzoite differentiation across multiple experimental systems. This consistent and dramatic bradyzoite-specific expression pattern suggests the gene likely plays a <strong>critical role in chronic infection biology</strong>, potentially involved in cyst formation, maintenance, or bradyzoite-specific metabolic processes essential for parasite persistence in the host.",
