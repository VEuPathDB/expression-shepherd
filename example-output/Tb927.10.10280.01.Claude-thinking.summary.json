  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene shows <strong>complex stage-specific expression patterns</strong> in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, with generally higher levels in bloodstream forms compared to procyclic forms, though interpretation is complicated by the presence of 3 paralogs. Key regulatory features include: <ul><li><strong>Cell cycle-dependent expression</strong> with peak levels during S-phase suggesting involvement in DNA replication processes</li><li><strong>Enhanced expression in host tissues</strong> including adipose tissue and cerebrospinal fluid compared to circulating blood</li><li><strong>Post-transcriptional regulation</strong> through XRNA-mediated mRNA degradation and evidence of reduced translational efficiency in bloodstream forms</li></ul> The combination of S-phase expression timing and tissue-specific upregulation suggests this gene may play a role in cell division processes that are adapted to specific host microenvironments.",
