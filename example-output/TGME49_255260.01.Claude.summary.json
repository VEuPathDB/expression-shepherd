Key expression patterns include: <ul><li>Peak expression in bradyzoites (2,713 TPM, 99.66th percentile) and tachyzoites (1,593-4,767 TPM)</li><li>Dramatic >400-fold upregulation during oocyst sporulation</li><li>Complete silencing (<3 TPM) in all feline enteroepithelial sexual stages</li><li>Biphasic expression pattern during tachyzoite time courses</li></ul> The consistent high expression in replicating stages and complete repression during sexual development suggests this gene encodes a <strong>critical component of the asexual replication machinery</strong>, possibly involved in DNA replication, cell division, or metabolic processes essential for rapid parasite multiplication but incompatible with sexual differentiation.",
