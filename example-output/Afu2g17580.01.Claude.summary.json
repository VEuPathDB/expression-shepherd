Key patterns include: <ul><li><strong>Nutrient-dependent regulation</strong> - severely downregulated under zinc/nitrate limitation (77-fold) and iron starvation (14-fold)</li><li><strong>Developmental specificity</strong> - highly expressed in dormant conidia but strongly repressed during germination and hyphal growth</li><li><strong>Stress responsiveness</strong> - upregulated by hypoxia (3-7 fold) and hydrogen peroxide, but downregulated by antifungal treatments</li><li><strong>Antisense transcription</strong> - consistently high antisense expression across conditions suggests complex transcriptional regulation</li></ul>The coordinated responses to metal availability, oxidative stress, and developmental transitions suggest this gene may function in <strong>stress-responsive metabolic regulation</strong> or cellular homeostasis pathways.",
