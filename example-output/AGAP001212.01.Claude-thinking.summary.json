  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>highly tissue-specific expression</strong> in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> digestive tissues, with strongest expression in <strong>midgut, salivary glands, and gastric caeca</strong> across multiple developmental stages. The gene displays <strong>robust circadian rhythmicity</strong> with peak expression during subjective night and shows <strong>temporal responsiveness to blood feeding</strong> with maximum expression at 24 hours post-meal. <strong>Sexual dimorphism</strong> is evident, with generally higher expression in females, particularly in whole-body samples. The gene also responds to <strong>parasite infections</strong> and shows upregulation in <strong>insecticide-resistant mosquitoes</strong>. Given its consistent enrichment in secretory and digestive tissues, this gene likely functions in <strong>digestive or secretory processes</strong> critical for mosquito physiology and potentially vector competence.",
