  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>dramatic developmental regulation</strong>, with highest expression in dormant conidia (68.1 TPM) compared to germinated forms, suggesting a role in maintaining dormancy. Expression is <strong>strongly controlled by the ACE1 transcription factor</strong>, showing a 60-fold reduction in deletion mutants, and responds robustly to environmental stresses. <ul><li>Iron starvation causes 7-fold downregulation</li><li>Hypoxic conditions induce 4-fold upregulation over 36 hours</li><li>Cell wall stress from Congo Red dramatically reduces expression</li></ul> The gene consistently produces more antisense than sense transcripts across conditions, indicating potential regulatory complexity. With 11 paralogs, this gene family likely plays important roles in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> stress adaptation and developmental transitions.",
