  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits consistently high expression levels across diverse experimental conditions in <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, ranking in the 85th-98th percentiles of the transcriptome. <strong>Key expression patterns include:</strong> <ul><li>Strong temporal upregulation during conidia germination (5-15 fold increases)</li><li>Peak expression during sexual development, particularly at 3 days post-fertilization</li><li>Upregulation in response to starch-derived carbon sources like maltose and amylose</li><li>Enhanced expression in several mutant backgrounds including delta sah-2, stc-1, and Δve-1 strains</li></ul> The gene's constitutively high expression combined with developmental and metabolic responsiveness suggests it may encode an essential cellular component involved in growth processes, potentially related to carbohydrate metabolism or cellular development given its strong responses to germination stages and starch substrates.",
