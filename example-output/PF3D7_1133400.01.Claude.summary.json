  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits one of the most dramatic stage-specific expression patterns in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, with <strong>exceptionally high expression in sporozoites (>3000 TPM, 99th percentile) and late schizont stages (>1500 TPM, 96-99th percentile)</strong>, while maintaining minimal expression during trophozoite stages (<50 TPM). The gene shows <ul><li>Over 300-fold upregulation from trophozoites to schizonts during asexual development</li><li>Dramatically higher expression in mosquito-derived versus cultured sporozoites</li><li>Consistent biphasic expression patterns during intraerythrocytic development cycles</li></ul>. The extreme sporozoite-specific expression and late schizont upregulation suggest this gene plays critical roles in <strong>parasite transmission, host cell invasion, or late-stage replication processes</strong>, potentially functioning in sporozoite infectivity or merozoite formation.",
