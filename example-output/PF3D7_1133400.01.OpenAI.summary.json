Several studies highlight its role during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, where its expression peaks during the schizont stage and declines at the trophozoite stage. </li> <li>Moreover, the gene demonstrates stage-specific upregulation in late sporozoite and merozoite stages, suggesting its involvement in parasite development and possibly invasion mechanisms. </li> <li>Additionally, its expression varies across environmental and experimental conditions, including stress and lifecycle stage comparisons. </li> Further research may elucidate its precise functional roles within these contexts.</ul>",
