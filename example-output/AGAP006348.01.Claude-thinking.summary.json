  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>highly tissue-specific expression</strong> in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, with over 50-fold enrichment in salivary glands compared to midgut and substantial expression in chemosensory organs (maxillary palps >> antennae) and immune cells (hemocytes). The gene shows <strong>clear circadian rhythmicity</strong> with peak expression at subjective midnight and <strong>developmental upregulation</strong> during late larval stages and embryogenesis. Expression responds dynamically to <ul><li>environmental stresses (heat shock, ivermectin treatment)</li><li>pathogen infections (differential patterns with <i>Plasmodium</i> and <i>Wolbachia</i>)</li><li>reproductive processes (blood feeding, hormonal stimulation)</li></ul>. The pronounced salivary gland enrichment combined with stress responsiveness suggests potential roles in vector biology, possibly related to blood feeding, pathogen transmission, or host-seeking behaviors.",
