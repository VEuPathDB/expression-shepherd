Elevated expression is observed under conditions such as nutrient limitation, hypoxia, and specific temperature treatments, compared to lower expression levels in stress conditions like fluconazole exposure or mutant strains like cfo1 and ada2. </li> <li>Stationary and log growth phases often show increases in transcript levels, and environment-specific variations highlight regulatory responsiveness in biological processes like pathogenicity and stress adaptation. </li> <li>Altogether, the evidence proposes roles in critical cellular responses, including nutrient processing, thermal regulation, and likely phase-specific development pathways within <i>C. neoformans</i>.</li> </ul>",
