  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>dramatic stage-specific expression patterns</strong> across the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> lifecycle, with <strong>peak expression in ookinetes</strong> (2375.92 TPM, 99th percentile) representing a >500-fold increase over other stages. During intraerythrocytic development, the gene shows <strong>biphasic expression</strong> with highest levels in ring stages (19-32 TPM) and minimal expression during trophozoite and schizont stages (3-9 TPM). <ul><li>Male gametocytes show specific expression while female gametocytes remain silent</li><li>Expression is cyclical with ~24-hour periodicity during blood stages</li><li>Field isolates express higher levels than laboratory strains</li></ul> The extreme ookinete-specific upregulation suggests specialized functions in mosquito midgut development, while the ring-stage periodicity indicates roles in early parasite establishment and cell cycle regulation.",
