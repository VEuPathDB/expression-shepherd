  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>dramatic stage-specific expression</strong> in <i>Plasmodium berghei</i>, with its most striking feature being >100-fold upregulation in ookinetes (>2000 TPM) compared to all other life cycle stages. Expression patterns show <strong>sexual stage preference</strong>, with moderate levels in gametocytes (~30-60 TPM) and particularly strong female gametocyte bias (6-fold higher than males). The gene shows <strong>minimal expression in asexual blood stages</strong> (~1 TPM) and variable, generally low expression during liver stages. <ul><li>Ookinete-specific expression suggests critical roles in mosquito stage development and transmission</li><li>Female gametocyte preference indicates involvement in sexual differentiation processes</li><li>Regulation by AP2 transcription factors suggests integration into sexual development pathways</li></ul>",
