Notably, highest expression was observed in 5'-SL-end enriched libraries.</li> <li>Significant increases in expression occur in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, the LS stage under glucose influence, and upon differentiation via RNAi studies, hinting at diverse regulatory patterns.</li> <li>Insights into expression trends in experimental modifications (e.g., Orc1/Cdc6-depletion) further emphasize this gene's functional relevance across the parasiteâ€™s lifecycle and adaptations.</li> </ul>",
