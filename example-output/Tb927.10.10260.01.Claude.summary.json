Expression levels reach <strong>exceptionally high percentile rankings (>99th percentile)</strong> in procyclic forms, indicating it is among the most abundant transcripts in the insect vector stage. <ul><li>Shows strong tissue specificity within the tsetse fly, with highest expression in the midgut</li><li>Maintains high expression throughout procyclic cell cycle phases</li><li>Exhibits modest circadian oscillations under temperature cycling conditions</li></ul> The consistent procyclic-specific upregulation and midgut preference strongly suggest this gene encodes a protein critical for parasite survival and metabolism during the insect vector stage of the life cycle.",
