  "headline": "Dramatically elevated expression during feline enteroepithelial stages with consistent upregulation in merozoites",
  "one_paragraph_summary": "This gene exhibits <strong>dramatic stage-specific upregulation</strong> during <i>Toxoplasma gondii's</i> sexual cycle, with expression levels exceeding 4,000 TPM in feline enteroepithelial stages compared to ~130 TPM in tachyzoites and ~54 TPM in tissue cysts. The gene shows <strong>consistent upregulation in merozoites</strong> (4-7 fold higher than tachyzoites) and demonstrates <strong>cell cycle-regulated expression</strong> with periodic oscillations in tachyzoites. Expression varies significantly across parasite strains and is consistently high throughout acute infection phases. The gene maintains high expression during chronic bradyzoite stages and shows <strong>strain-dependent responses</strong> to differentiation stimuli. Given its dramatic upregulation during sexual stages and merozoite formation, this gene likely plays a critical role in <i>T. gondii's</i> reproductive cycle and stage transitions within the feline host.",
